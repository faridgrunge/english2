    <p>Myself : Assalamu Alaikum<br />
Manager : Walaikum Assalam</p>

<p>Myself : May I come in sir?<br />
Manager : Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Myself : Can I have a seat sir?<br />
Manager : Sure.</p>

<p>Myself : Thank you.<br />
Manager : Welcome. What can I do for you?</p>

<p>Myself : I want to open an account with your bank.<br />
Manager : Ok, it&rsquo;s very good.</p>

<p>Myself : But I don&rsquo;t know how to open an account sir.<br />
Manager : Will you tell me what kind of account you want to open?</p>

<p>Myself : Actually I have got a handsome amount of money as scholarship.<br />
Manager : And now you want to save it, OK?</p>

<p>Myself : Yes, you are right sir.<br />
Manager : I am giving you a form to fill it up. Just fill it up with the information required in different serial. After filling up the form, come to me with two passport size photographs of you and another copy of photograph of your beneficiary.</p>

<p>Myself : What type of account am I going to open sir?<br />
Manager : It is a saving account.</p>

<p>Myself : Would you explain what is saving account?<br />
Manager : It means you can save any amount of money at any time and you can withdraw any amount from your account at any time.</p>

<p>Myself : O, I see. Do I need to do anything more?<br />
Manager : Yes. You have to deposit an amount of initial money to open the account.</p>

<p>Myself : What is the amount sir?<br />
Manager : It may be at least one hundred or more than one hundred.</p>

<p>Myself : Thank you sir for your kind cooperation.<br />
Manager : You are most welcome.</p>
