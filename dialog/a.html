    <p>Myself : Hello, Jahid, how are you?<br />
Nabila : I'm ok. But I cannot think of living in Dhaka any more.</p>

<p>Myself : Why, any problem?<br />
Nabila : Really days are getting worse.</p>

<p>Myself : What are you telling about?<br />
Nabila : Traffic Jam. Can you think how disgusting it is?</p>

<p>
Myself : Oh! Really disgusting. I needed two hours to reach from Jatrabari to Dhanmondi .<br />
Nabila : Can you think it? What a boring city it is!</p>

<p>
Myself : It's one of the main problem of Dhaka.<br />
Nabila : People are disgusted.</p>

<p>
Myself : There's no rule in the city. Drivers stop bus here and there. <br />
Nabila : More than that is the un-experienced drivers. </p>

<p>
Myself : How can we get rid of it? <br />
Nabila : We have to tolerate it.</p>

<p>
Myself : Really we are unlucky. <br />
Nabila : Don't be so disheartened. Our Govt. is trying their best.</p>

<p>
Myself : Ok. Let's be hopeful.<br />
Nabila : Nothing to do. Thank you for your witty argument.</p>

<p>Myself : You're welcome.</p>
