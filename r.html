    <p>Myself : Assalamu Alaikum.<br />
Friend : Walaikum Assalam.</p>

<p>Myself : How are you my friend?<br />
Friend : Alhamdulillah and you?</p>

<p>Myself : I am also ok but I am afraid of some problems.<br />
Friend : What kind of problem?</p>

<p>Myself : Unemployment problem.<br />
Friend : What is unemployment problem?</p>

<p>Myself : When skilled people remain without work is called unemployment problem.<br />
Friend : Make me understand clearly please.</p>

<p>Myself : Suppose, my elder brother is an MA. He needs a job now but there is no vacancy in any<br />
office or anywhere. Now he is unemployed and it is a problem.<br />
Friend : Why is it a problem?</p>

<p>Myself : It is a problem because he cannot provide himself in any service for the country and he<br />
has no income.<br />
Friend : So what?</p>

<p>Myself : He is seemed as a burden of the family.<br />
Friend : Do you want to say that, as he has no income, he is a burden?</p>

<p>Myself : This is the reality. Everyone wants a job and income after his student life.<br />
Friend : Why is this problem raised in our country?</p>

<p>Myself : Scope. The government has not created sufficient scope for the unemployed people to<br />
provide them in any service.<br />
Friend : What should the government do?</p>

<p>
Myself : Government can provide them different kinds of training and export manpower to the<br />
other countries to solve this problem.<br />
Friend : Anything else?</p>

<p>
Myself : Yes. Government and Business magnets can establish more industries to provide them<br />
service and thus unemployment problem may be removed.<br />
Friend : How fine your idea is!</p>

<p>
Myself : Really? Thank you very much.<br />
Friend : Thank you also.</p>
